The zosupload [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] plugin is a utility to help with uploading z/OS source code as part of a Maven build lifecycle.

It is usually necessary to upload source files in different PDS libraries on z/OS and also to be able to submit JCL (such as compilation) on z/OS and check the return codes as part of the build process.
